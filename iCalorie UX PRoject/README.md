## How might we make the nutritional information of the food served at the UMD dining services more accessible/available?

The students at the University of Maryland currently have no reasonable access to nutritional information in the campus dining facilities. The FDA has mandated that restaurants must provide nutritional information to all consumers by 2018 (https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm515020.htm). This addition has helped consumers make much more balanced and informed decisions about their eating habits. While this obviously doesnâ€™t apply to college campuses, one of the easiest and fastest ways to improve Quality of Life on the UMD campus is to empower students to make healthier eating choices. Having the ability to know what the nutritional makeup of the food selection of will help students who have allergies and dietary restrictions feeling more comfortable eating at the campus facilities.

### our Goal 
Our solution to fix this problem is to raise educational awareness as well as provide students a systematic platform, a mobile application, through which meal recommendations will be given as per their needs. The recommendations produced by the mobile application will only be items available at the University dining halls and other on-campus facilities that accept dining dollars. The users that we will observe and interview are University of Maryland students at the University dining facilities. These are mostly freshman and sophomores (ages 18-20). We will also observe and interview the people involved in the dining services (ex: workers, management, the people who provide the food to be cooked). From these users, we hope to find out why students eat the way that they currently eat, and how the people who provide the food came to the decision of which foods to make available.
