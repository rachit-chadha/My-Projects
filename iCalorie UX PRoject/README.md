UX Project


How might we make the nutritional information of the food served at the
UMD dining services more accessible/available?

Our solution to fix this problem is to raise educational awareness as well as provide students a systematic platform, a mobile application, through which meal recommendations will be given as per their needs. The recommendations produced by the mobile application will only be items available at the University dining halls and other on-campus facilities that accept dining dollars. The users that we will observe and interview are University of Maryland students at the University dining facilities. These are mostly freshman and sophomores (ages 18-20). We will also observe and interview the people involved in the dining services (ex: workers, management, the people who provide the food to be cooked). From these users, we hope to find out why students eat the way that they currently eat, and how the people who provide the food came to the decision of which foods to make available.
